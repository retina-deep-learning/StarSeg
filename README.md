# StarSeg

Deep Learning for Multi-Label Segmentation of Optos Fundus Autofluorescence Images in Stargardt Disease 

This deep learning algorithm was trained to perform macular segmentation for grayscale Optos fundus autofluorescence images taken of patients with genetically confirmed Stargardt disease.

Prerequisites: 
Python 3.9.7 
Tensorflow 2.4.1 
Keras 2.6.0


The code used for training and cross-validation can be executed using 'run_train.py'.

The code used for automated segmentation of individual new images can be executed using 'run_predict.py'.
